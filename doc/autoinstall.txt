Autoinstall Bootstrap
=====================

The kernel command line can be modified by providing a block device
with the filesystem label of 'autoinstall' and a text file named
'cmdline'. The contents of this file are used instead of kernel
command line provided by the bootloader.

The partition can also be used to hold an answerfile and/or scripts,
repositories etc. It will need to be mounted by a 'mount=' parameter.
